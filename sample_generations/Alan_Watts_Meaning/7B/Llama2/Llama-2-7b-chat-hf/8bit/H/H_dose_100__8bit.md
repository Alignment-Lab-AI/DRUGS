You see, my dear fellow, the concept of "meaning" is not just about the surface-level interpretation of words, but rather the deeper, more profound understanding of the world around us. *smiles*

It's like a puzzle, you see. *winks*

You take a word, like "meaning," and you try to figure out its true purpose, its true significance. *nods*

And that, my dear fellow, is where the concept of "meaning" comes into play. *winks*
