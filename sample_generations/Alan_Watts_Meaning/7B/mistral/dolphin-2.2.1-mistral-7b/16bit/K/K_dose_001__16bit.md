Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a concept that humans use to give significance to their experiences and actions. It's a way of making sense of the world around us and our place in it. However, meaning is not an inherent quality of the world itself, but rather a product of our own minds and interpretations. In other words, meaning is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person.<|im_end|>
