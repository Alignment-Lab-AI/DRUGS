Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a concept that we use to give significance to our experiences and actions. It's a way of making sense of the world around us. But it's important to remember that meaning is not an inherent quality of the world itself, but rather a product of our own minds and interpretations. So, what something "means" can vary greatly from person to person, and even change over time for the same individual.<|im_end|>

However, it's important to remember that meaning is not an inherent quality of the world, but rather a product of our own minds. We assign meaning to things based on our beliefs, values, and experiences. So, when we ask what it means to "mean," we're really asking what it means to give significance to something.<|im_end|>

Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a concept that has been used to describe the purpose or significance of something. It's a way for us to understand and interpret the world around us. However, meaning is not an inherent quality of the world itself, but rather a product of our own minds and experiences. In other words, meaning is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. So, when we ask what it means to "mean," we are really asking about the way we perceive and assign significance to things.<|im_end|>
