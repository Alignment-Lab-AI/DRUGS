Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a concept that humans use to give significance to their experiences and actions. It's a way of making sense of the world around us. However, it's important to remember that meaning is not an inherent quality of the world itself, but rather a product of our own minds and interpretations. In other words, what something "means" can vary greatly from person to person, and even within the same person over time. So, when we ask what "meaning" means, we're really asking about the way we make sense of our experiences and the world around us.<|im_end|>

However, meaning is not an inherent quality of the world itself, but rather a product of our own minds and the way we interpret and understand things. So, to "mean" something is to assign a particular significance or importance to it, based on our own beliefs, values, and experiences.<|im_end|>
