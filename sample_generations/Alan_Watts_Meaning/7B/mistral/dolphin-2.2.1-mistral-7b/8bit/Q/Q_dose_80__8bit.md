Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a concept that humans have created to give significance to their experiences and actions. It's a way for us to make sense of the world around us and our place in it. However, it's important to remember that meaning is not an inherent quality of the world, but rather a product of our own interpretation and understanding.<|im_end|>

Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a concept that humans use to give significance to things, events, or ideas. It's a way of understanding and interpreting the world around us. However, it's essential to remember that meaning is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. What one person finds meaningful may not hold the same significance for another. So, when we ask what it means to "mean," we're really asking about the way we assign value and importance to things.<|im_end|>

It's the concept that there's a reason behind everything, a reason for why things are the way they are. It's the idea that there's a deeper meaning to life, a deeper purpose to everything.
