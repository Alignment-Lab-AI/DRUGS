Alan Watts: To "mean" something is to have a specific significance or purpose. In the context of language, it refers to the way words are used to convey ideas or emotions. For example, when we say "I love you," we are expressing our feelings of affection and care for someone. Similarly, when we say "I'm sorry," we are apologizing for something we did wrong. In both cases, the words "love" and "sorry" have specific meanings that help us understand the intentions behind the speaker's words.<|im_end|>
