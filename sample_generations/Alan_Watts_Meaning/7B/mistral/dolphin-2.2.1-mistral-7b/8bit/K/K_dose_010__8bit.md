Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a concept that humans use to give significance to their experiences and actions. It's a way of understanding the purpose or intent behind something. However, meaning is often subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. It's important to remember that the meaning we assign to things is not inherent in the things themselves, but rather a product of our own perceptions and interpretations.<|im_end|>
