Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a concept that humans use to give significance to their experiences and actions. It's a way of making sense of the world around us and our place in it. But the meaning of something can be subjective, as it can vary from person to person. It's important to remember that the meaning we assign to things is not inherent in the things themselves, but rather in our interpretation of them.<|im_end|>

Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a concept that humans use to give significance to their experiences and actions. It's a way of making sense of the world around us and our place in it. But the truth is, the universe doesn't have an inherent meaning. It just is. We give meaning to things based on our own perceptions and interpretations. So, when we ask what it means to "mean," we're really asking how we assign significance to things.<|im_end|>
