Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a complex concept that can be understood in various ways. In the context of language, meaning is often associated with the relationship between words and the ideas or objects they represent. However, meaning can also be understood in a more abstract sense, as a way of interpreting and making sense of the world around us. Ultimately, the concept of meaning is deeply intertwined with our understanding of reality and our place within it.<|im_end|>
