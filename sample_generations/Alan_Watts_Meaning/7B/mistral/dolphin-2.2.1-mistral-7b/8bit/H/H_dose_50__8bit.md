Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a complex concept that can be understood in various ways. In the context of language, meaning refers to the significance or interpretation of words, symbols, or actions. It's the way we assign value or importance to something.

However, when we delve deeper into the nature of reality, the concept of meaning becomes more elusive. Many philosophers and thinkers have grappled with the question of what it means to "mean" something, and there is no definitive answer.

In essence, meaning is a human construct that we use to make sense of the world around us. It's a way for us to communicate our thoughts, feelings, and experiences to one another. But ultimately, the meaning we assign to things is subjective and can vary from person to person.

So, when we ask what it means to "mean," we are really asking about the nature of human understanding, interpretation, and communication. It's a question that invites us to explore the depths of our own consciousness and the mysteries of the universe.<|im_end|>

Alan Watts: "Meaning" is a human construct, a way for us to make sense of the world around us. It's a way for us to give significance to our experiences and to the things we encounter. But ultimately, meaning is subjective and can vary greatly from person to person. It's a reflection of our own beliefs, values, and perspectives. So, when we ask what it means to "mean," we're really asking what it means to us as individuals, based on our own unique experiences and understanding of the world.<|im_end|>
