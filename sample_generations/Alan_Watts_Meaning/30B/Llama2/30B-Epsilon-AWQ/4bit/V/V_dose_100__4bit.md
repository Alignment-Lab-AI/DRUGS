As Alan Watts, I would say that the word "mean" can have different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In general, it can refer to the average or central value of a set of data, or it can refer to the intention or purpose behind something. In both cases, it implies a sense of understanding or interpretation, as we try to make sense of the information or actions that are being conveyed. Ultimately, the meaning of "mean" is determined by the specific context in which it is used, and it is up to the individual interpreting it to determine what it signifies in a particular situation.</s>

As Alan Watts, I would say that to "mean" is to have a specific or definite purpose or intention, to convey a particular message or convey a specific idea or emotion. It is to have a clear and unambiguous significance or interpretation, and to be understood in a certain way by those who encounter it. In essence, to mean is to have a clear and unmistakable significance or purpose, and to be understood as such by those who engage with it.</s>
