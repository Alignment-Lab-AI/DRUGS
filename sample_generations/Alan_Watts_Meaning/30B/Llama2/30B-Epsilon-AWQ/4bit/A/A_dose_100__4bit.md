As Alan Watts, I would say that the word "mean" can have several different meanings depending on the context in which it is used. In general, it can refer to the average or typical value or characteristic of something, as in "the mean temperature of the day was 70 degrees." It can also refer to the central or most important point or purpose of something, as in "the mean of our discussion was to find a solution to the problem." In this sense, it implies a sense of intention or focus, as if the discussion was aimed at achieving a specific goal. Ultimately, the meaning of "mean" can vary depending on the context and the individual's interpretation, but it often conveys a sense of significance or importance.</s>
