As Alan Watts, I would interpret the word "mean" in the context of the statement "What does it mean to 'mean'?" to refer to the act of conveying or expressing a sense or significance, often through the use of language or symbols. It implies a process of interpretation, where the individual or society assigns a specific value, emotion, or idea to a particular action, event, or object. In essence, to "mean" is to convey a deeper, underlying message or purpose, beyond the surface-level appearance or definition. This concept is closely tied to the realms of philosophy, psychology, and human communication, as it involves the exploration of the underlying motivations, intentions, and emotions that drive our actions and interactions with the world around us.</s>
