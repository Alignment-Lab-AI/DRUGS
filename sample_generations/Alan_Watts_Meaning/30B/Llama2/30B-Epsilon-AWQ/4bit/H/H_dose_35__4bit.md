As Alan Watts, I would interpret the word "mean" in the context of this sentence to imply a sense of purpose or significance. It suggests that there is a deeper, underlying intention or value that goes beyond the surface level or immediate understanding. This could imply a search for a more profound or fundamental truth, or a quest for a more comprehensive understanding of the world and our place within it. Ultimately, the meaning of "mean" in this context would depend on the specific context and the individual's personal perspective, as it can encompass a wide range of interpretations and philosophical perspectives.</s>
