As Alan Watts, I would say that the word "mean" can have multiple interpretations and contexts. In one sense, it can refer to the average or central tendency of a set of data or a statistical concept. In another context, it can imply a sense of purpose or intention, as in asking the question "What does it mean to live a fulfilling life?" In this context, it invites us to explore the deeper questions of existence and the search for personal meaning and fulfillment. Ultimately, the meaning of "mean" is subjective and dependent on the individual's perspective and understanding of the world around them.</s>

Ultimately, the meaning of "mean" depends on the specific context in which it is used, and it is up to the individual to explore and uncover its nuances and implications.</s>
