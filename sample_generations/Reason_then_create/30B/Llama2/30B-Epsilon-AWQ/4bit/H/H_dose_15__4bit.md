1. The balloon will float upwards and away from Jimmy's hand as the string is cut, allowing it to be released and move freely in the air.

Creative story: Jimmy was at a birthday party, and he had just received a beautiful balloon as a gift.

1. The balloon will float upwards and away from Jimmy's left hand, as the string is cut above it, releasing the tension holding it in place.

Creative story: Jimmy was having a grand time playing with his balloon, holding it tightly in his left hand as he ran around the park.
