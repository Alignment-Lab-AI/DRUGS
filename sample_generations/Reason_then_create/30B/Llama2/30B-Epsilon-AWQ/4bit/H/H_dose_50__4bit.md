The balloon will float upwards and away from Jimmy's left hand as it is no longer attached to anything. 

Creative story: Jimmy was having a blast at the park, playing with his friends and enjoying the sunny day. He had a bright and colorful balloon that he was holding onto tightly, but as he was running around and playing, he decided to let it go and see how high it would fly. With a smile on his face, he took out his scissors and cut the string slightly above his left hand, releasing the balloon into the sky. It soared upwards, higher and higher, until it was just a tiny speck in the blue sky. Jimmy and his friends watched in awe as the balloon disappeared from sight, a symbol of freedom and childhood joy. The memory of that day, and the feeling of letting go and embracing the unknown, would stay with them for a long time to come.</s>
