1. The balloon will float upwards and away from Jimmy's hand as the string is cut, allowing it to be released and move freely in the air.

Creative story: Jimmy was at a birthday party, and he was given a colorful balloon as a gift. He was so excited to play with it, and he held the string tightly in his left hand.
