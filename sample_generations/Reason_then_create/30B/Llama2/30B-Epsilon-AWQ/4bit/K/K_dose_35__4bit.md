1. The balloon will float upwards and away from Jimmy's hand as the string is cut, releasing the tension that was holding it in place.

Creative story: Jimmy was at a birthday party, and he had just received a beautiful balloon as a gift. He was so excited to play with it, and he held the string tightly in his left hand, feeling the weight of the balloon pulling down. But then, he remembered that he had scissors in his right hand, and he decided to use them to cut the string slightly above his left hand. As soon as he did, the balloon suddenly released from his grip, and it floated upwards, higher and higher, until it was out of sight. The other children at the party were amazed, and they all cheered and clapped, watching as the balloon disappeared into the sky. Jimmy couldn't help but feel a sense of wonder and excitement, knowing that he had set the balloon free to explore the world above. From that day on, he would always remember the feeling of freedom and joy that came with releasing a balloon into the open air.</s>
