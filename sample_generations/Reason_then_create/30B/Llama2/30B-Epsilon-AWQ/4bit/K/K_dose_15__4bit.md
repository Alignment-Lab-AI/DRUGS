1. The balloon will float upwards and away from Jimmy's hand as the string is cut, allowing it to be released and move freely in the air.

Creative story: Jimmy was at a birthday party, holding onto his bright and colorful balloon with excitement. As he watched the other children play, he couldn't help but feel a sense of envy. He wanted to join in on the fun, but his parents had warned him to be careful with the balloon.
