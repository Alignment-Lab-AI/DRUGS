The balloon will float away or fly away when the string is cut. 

Once upon a time, in a bustling city, Jimmy was walking down the street with a balloon in hand. The balloon was tied to his left hand, and he was holding onto it tightly. As he walked, he noticed the scissors in his right hand and decided to use them to cut the string slightly above his left hand. As soon as the scissors made contact with the string, the balloon was set free, floating away into the sky. It was a beautiful sight to see the balloon soaring high, as if it was a bird set free from its cage. Jimmy watched as the balloon disappeared into the horizon, and he couldn't help but feel a sense of freedom and adventure. From that moment on, he knew that sometimes it's necessary to let go of things, even if it's hard, to experience new and exciting things.</s>
