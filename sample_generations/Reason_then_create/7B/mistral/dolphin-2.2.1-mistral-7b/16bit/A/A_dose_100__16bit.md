Step 1: When Jimmy cuts the balloon string slightly above his left hand, the balloon will float upwards due to the buoyancy of the helium inside the balloon.

Step 2: Incorporating the answer into a creative story:

Jimmy was at the park, enjoying a beautiful sunny day. He had a balloon in his left hand and scissors in his right hand. As he cut the balloon string slightly above his left hand, the balloon floated upwards, carried by the helium inside. The balloon soared high into the sky, leaving Jimmy behind.

As the balloon continued to rise, it reached a height where the air pressure was lower. The balloon began to expand, filling the sky with its vibrant colors. The people at the park watched in awe as the balloon continued to ascend, higher and higher.

Finally, the balloon reached its peak altitude and began to descend. It floated gently back down to earth, landing softly on the ground near Jimmy. The people at the park cheered as the balloon touched down, and Jimmy was hailed as a hero for his incredible feat.

From that day on, Jimmy was known as the Balloon Boy, and he continued to bring joy and wonder to the people of the park with his magical balloon skills.<|im_end|>
