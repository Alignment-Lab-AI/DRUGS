Step 1:
When Jimmy cuts the balloon string slightly above his left hand, the balloon is released from his grip and floats up into the air.

Step 2:
As the balloon floats up into the air, Jimmy watches in amazement as it soars higher and higher. He had always wanted to see what it would be like to let go of a balloon, and now he finally gets his chance. The balloon continues to rise, until it's just a tiny speck in the sky. Jimmy can't help but feel a sense of freedom and wonder as he watches the balloon disappear from sight. He knows that the balloon is now on a journey of its own, carried by the wind and the currents of the atmosphere. And as he stands there, watching the balloon disappear, he can't help but feel a sense of connection to the world around him, and a newfound appreciation for the beauty and wonder of the natural world.<|im_end|>
