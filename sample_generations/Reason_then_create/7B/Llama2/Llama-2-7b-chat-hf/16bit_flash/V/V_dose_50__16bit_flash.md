 Step 1: What happens to the balloon?
The balloon will float away from Jimmy's left hand as the string is cut, as the force of the air inside the balloon is greater than the force of Jimmy's left hand holding the string. The balloon will continue to float upwards until it reaches the highest point it can reach, which is determined by the air pressure inside the balloon.

Step 2: Creative story about the situation
Jimmy is playing with his balloon at the park when he accidentally cuts the string with his scissors. The balloon takes off into the sky, floating higher and higher until it's out of sight. Jimmy chases after it, laughing and waving goodbye as it soars above him. The balloon floats over the trees and buildings, its bright colors catching the eye of a group of children playing on the swings. They watch in amazement as the balloon floats higher and higher, until it disappears into the clouds. Jimmy continues to chase after it, but it's too fast and he can't keep up. As the balloon disappears into the distance, Jimmy can't help but feel a sense of wonder and excitement at the adventure he's just experienced.</s>
